"""
In a process with couple of threads, just one thread will be run in a single time.
As Threads are shared memory, Python Interpreter prefer to execute one thread at a time.

Python is not thread-safe, and was originally designed with something called the GIL,
or Global Interpreter Lock, that ensures processes are executed serially on a computerâ€™s CPU.
On the surface, this means Python programs cannot support multiprocessing.

GIL stop threads when they are using CPU not when they wait
All threads start and stop at almost same time
